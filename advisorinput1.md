Detailed Error Analysis and Solution for Roastd AI Image Generation (Updated)

Executive Summary

This report provides an updated and highly focused analysis of the persistent issues preventing successful AI image generation and inbox population within the Roastd application. Based on the latest advisorai1.md.docx document, a critical bug has been identified in the web interface where the session_id (UUID) is being incorrectly passed instead of the link_code (string) to the nano-banana Supabase Edge Function. This fundamental error is the root cause of the

long-standing "Session not found" errors, preventing the AI image generation workflow from even initiating. This report will detail this critical bug, provide a precise solution, and re-emphasize the subsequent steps required to achieve full functionality.

1. Critical Bug Identification: Web Interface Parameter Mismatch

1.1. The Root Cause: currentSessionId vs. linkCode

Description: The advisorai1.md.docx explicitly highlights a critical bug in the web interface's JavaScript implementation for submitting prompts to the nano-banana Supabase Edge Function. Instead of passing the link_code (which is a string extracted from the URL parameter ?code=...), the web interface is erroneously passing currentSessionId (which is the session_id UUID retrieved from the database) in the body of the invoke call. [1, Page 23]

Observed Behavior (Revisited with New Insight):

‚Ä¢
The mobile app successfully creates sessions and generates unique link_codes (e.g., pFkHmQiz). [1, Page 21]

‚Ä¢
The web interface correctly extracts the link_code from the URL (e.g., localhost:8000/unique-pic-id/index.html?code=pFkHmQiz). [1, Page 22]

‚Ä¢
The web interface then uses this link_code to successfully fetch session_id, original_photo_url, and roast_prompt from the roast_sessions table. [1, Page 22]

‚Ä¢
However, when submitting the prompt to the nano-banana function, the body of the request contains link_code: currentSessionId instead of link_code: linkCode. [1, Page 23]

‚Ä¢
The nano-banana function, expecting a link_code string, receives a session_id UUID. Since no link_code in the database matches this UUID, the supabaseClient.from('roast_sessions').select(...).eq('link_code', link_code).single() query consistently fails with "Session not found" or "Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object" errors. [1, Page 22]

Impact: This single parameter mismatch is the primary blocker preventing the entire AI image generation workflow from proceeding. The nano-banana function never gets past the session lookup stage, meaning the Gemini API is never called, no AI images are generated, and the inbox remains empty. All previous efforts to debug the Gemini API integration or streaming response parsing were premature because the function wasn't even reaching that part of the code.

1.2. Why Previous Debugging Was Misleading

The previous debugging efforts, including adding console.log for the link_code within the nano-banana function, showed that the function was receiving a value for link_code. However, the critical insight from advisorai1.md.docx reveals that this value was the session_id UUID, not the actual link_code string. This explains why the database query, which correctly looked for a link_code string, failed to find a match when given a UUID.

2. Precise Solution: Fixing the Web Interface Parameter Passing

The solution to this critical bug is straightforward: ensure the web interface passes the correct link_code string to the nano-banana function.

Action: Modify the submitPrompt function in /web/unique-pic-id/index.html to use the linkCode variable instead of currentSessionId when invoking the Supabase Edge Function.

Detailed Changes in /web/unique-pic-id/index.html:

Locate the submitPrompt function (or similar function responsible for invoking nano-banana). The problematic line is:

JavaScript


// Problematic line
link_code: currentSessionId, // ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL BUG: Using session_id instead of link_code


This line needs to be changed to:

JavaScript


// Corrected line
link_code: linkCode, // ‚úÖ Use the linkCode extracted from the URL


Full corrected submitPrompt (example based on provided snippet):

JavaScript


// Assuming linkCode is already extracted from the URL, e.g.:
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const linkCode = urlParams.get("code");

// ... other code ...

async function submitPrompt() {
  const promptText = document.getElementById("promptInput").value; // Assuming you have an input field

  // Ensure linkCode is available in this scope
  if (!linkCode) {
    console.error("Error: linkCode not found. Cannot submit prompt.");
    alert("Error: Session ID not found. Please refresh the page.");
    return;
  }

  const { data, error } = await supabaseClient.functions.invoke("nano-banana", {
    body: {
      link_code: linkCode, // THIS IS THE CRITICAL FIX
      prompt: promptText,
    },
  });

  if (error) {
    console.error("Error invoking nano-banana function:", error);
    alert("There was an error sending your message. Please try again.");
  } else {
    console.log("Function invoked successfully:", data);
    alert("Prompt submitted successfully!");
    // You might want to refresh the page or update UI here
  }
}


Explanation of the Fix:

By changing link_code: currentSessionId to link_code: linkCode, you ensure that the nano-banana Edge Function receives the correct link_code string, which matches the link_code stored in your roast_sessions table. This will allow the supabaseClient.from('roast_sessions').select(...).eq('link_code', link_code).single() query to successfully find the session.

3. Subsequent Steps and Verification (Re-emphasized)

Once the critical web interface bug is resolved, the nano-banana function should be able to successfully retrieve the session data. At this point, the focus shifts to the subsequent stages of the workflow. The following steps, previously detailed, remain crucial for full functionality:

3.1. Verify Gemini API Integration and Streaming Response Parsing

‚Ä¢
Action: Monitor the nano-banana function logs closely after deploying the web interface fix. Look for successful Gemini API calls and the üñºÔ∏è Found image data in chunk! log, indicating successful parsing of the streaming response.

‚Ä¢
Potential Issues: If 500 errors from Gemini persist, re-verify the mimeType and the arrayBufferToBase64 conversion for the originalImageBase64. Ensure the contentType for the Supabase Storage upload is also correct (image/jpeg).

‚Ä¢
Current Implementation: The advisorai1.md.docx confirms that the current REST API implementation for Gemini is in place and includes manual streaming response parsing. This approach is viable, but careful attention to the parsing logic is needed. [1, Page 17-18]

3.2. Ensure Correct Image Upload to Supabase Storage and Database Updates

‚Ä¢
Action: Confirm that the AI-generated image is successfully uploaded to Supabase Storage and that the generated_photo_url in the roast_sessions table is updated with the new URL. Look for logs like ‚úÖ Generated image uploaded to Supabase Storage: and ‚úÖ Roast session updated successfully with generated image:.

3.3. Address Empty Inbox Table

‚Ä¢
Action: Once AI image generation and roast_sessions updates are successful, verify that the inbox table is populated. Ensure the inbox insertion logic within nano-banana is correctly implemented and uses the session_id from the retrieved session and the finalImageUrl of the AI-generated image.

4. Deployment and Testing Strategy

1.
Update /web/unique-pic-id/index.html: Apply the critical fix to pass linkCode instead of currentSessionId.

2.
Deploy the updated web interface: Ensure the changes are live.

3.
Deploy the nano-banana function (if any changes were made to it):

4.
Perform a new test roast: Use the mobile app to create a new session, then access the web interface using the new link_code.

5.
Monitor Supabase Function Logs: Observe the nano-banana logs for successful session lookup, Gemini API calls, image generation, and database updates.

6.
Check Supabase Table Editor: Verify roast_sessions has generated_photo_url populated and inbox has new entries.

7.
Check Mobile Inbox: Confirm the AI-generated image appears.

Conclusion

The week-long struggle to resolve the AI image generation issues in Roastd can be attributed to a single, critical parameter passing error in the web interface. By correctly passing the link_code string instead of the session_id UUID to the nano-banana Supabase Edge Function, the primary blocker will be removed, allowing the rest of the AI image generation workflow to execute. Once this fundamental issue is addressed, the previously identified potential issues with Gemini API response parsing and inbox population can be verified and fine-tuned. This precise fix should enable your AI advisor to successfully implement the solution and get Roastd fully operational.

*   **Action:** Confirm that the AI-generated image is successfully uploaded to Supabase Storage and that the `generated_photo_url` in the `roast_sessions` table is updated with the new URL. Look for logs like `‚úÖ Generated image uploaded to Supabase Storage:` and `‚úÖ Roast session updated successfully with generated image:`.

### 3.3. Address Empty Inbox Table

*   **Action:** Once AI image generation and `roast_sessions` updates are successful, verify that the `inbox` table is populated. Ensure the `inbox` insertion logic within `nano-banana` is correctly implemented and uses the `session_id` from the retrieved session and the `finalImageUrl` of the AI-generated image.

    supabase functions deploy nano-banana --no-verify-jwt
    ```
4.  **Perform a new test roast:** Use the mobile app to create a new session, then access the web interface using the new `link_code`.
5.  **Monitor Supabase Function Logs:** Observe the `nano-banana` logs for successful session lookup, Gemini API calls, image generation, and database updates.
6.  **Check Supabase Table Editor:** Verify `roast_sessions` has `generated_photo_url` populated and `inbox` has new entries.
