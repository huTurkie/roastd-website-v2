PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: September 20, 2025


This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Roastd ("we", "us", or "our") and how we collect, use and disclose the personal information about individuals who use our mobile application, website (https://roastd.link/) and any other sites or services (collectively, the "Services"). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "you" and "your" means you as the user of the Services.


Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

1. INTRODUCTION


Roastd allows users to receive AI-generated roast messages about photos they upload through their social media. This is how it works:


The Roastd app permits a user ("App User") to upload a photo and generate a Roastd link that can be shared on social media platforms like Instagram Stories. When friends click on the Roastd link, they can submit prompts about the photo. The App User receives AI-generated roast messages based on these prompts and can view them in the mobile app.


To protect the safety of our users, we employ content moderation and safety measures.
